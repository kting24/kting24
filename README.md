### ðŸ“Š About Me

My ultimate goal is to leverage technology to create a meaningful impact on those around me.

### ðŸŒ± Current Focus
I'm currently building more with **Tableau**! I love how it combines technical skills, storytelling, and creativity - allowing me to dive deeper into data visualization and analysis. You can find my current progress [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/karen.ting/vizzes).
